USB has multiple different configurations to support various functions and different types of data transfer.</p><p>Alternate Setting is an option within a specific interface of USB devices, allowing multiple functions to be supported by configuring different features or data endpoints within the same interface. This means that when a USB device has multiple different functions or operating modes, it can switch between these functions using different Alternate Settings.</p><p>For example, a USB audio device may have various audio formats and sampling rates. By using different Alternate Settings, it can switch between different audio configurations to accommodate different application requirements. Another example is a USB camera, which may have different resolutions and image compression formats, and these settings can be chosen through Alternate Settings.</p><p>When communicating between a USB device and a host, the host can select an Alternate Setting by sending specific control commands. Once a new Alternate Setting is chosen, the device will reconfigure its data endpoints according to the new configuration to accommodate the new function or operating mode.</p><p>In summary, Alternate Setting is an important feature of USB devices, which allows the device to support multiple functions within the same interface and switch flexibly when needed.</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://practicegithub2016.github.io/>&copy; Laba Gossip 2023</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
